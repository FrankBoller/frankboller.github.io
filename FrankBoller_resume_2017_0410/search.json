["Frank Boller 12661 Deermeadow St, Moorpark, CA, 93021 Email: FrankBoller@hotmail.com Java Developer / Team Lead / Hands-on Architect I have implemented Agile Principals as a team sport to insure continuous improvement and focus on quality and customer satisfaction. Have engaged with senior management, partners, and staff to visualize and implement complex projects from concept to completion and driven infrastructure towards agile CI/CD, virtualization, and containers. Collaborating with customers, I have modeled IT systems to capture and articulate external, structural, interaction, and behavioral views. Practicing Model Driven Architecture (MDA) has allowed migration to other vendors and cloud based solutions. (Although have worked predominantly with Oracle) Utilizing emerging technologies, have transformed manual processes with best practice data models enabling auto generation of schema, ORM, tests, and persistence API. My experience with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has focused on enterprise integration patterns, dynamic routing, message queuing, and pluggable components. Generating interaction models for contract-first application interfaces has enabled cost efficiency, optimization and significant independence from product lock-in. Have worked with a wide variety of industries (Government, Manufacturing, Electronics, Internet, Financial, Entertainment, and Media), involving an expansive set of technologies, processes, and customer expectations. My successful track record shows ability to ramp up rapidly and perform.
